This is a testament the continuous enrichment Starbucks provides through its learning and development programs, such as the Coffee Master certification program, which allows our partners (employees) to develop their proficiency and skills in all things coffee. Starbucks Coffee Masters are easily identifiable by their black aprons, which acknowledges their coffee knowledge and passion for craft."
